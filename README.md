ReHUD is a custom, configurable, easy-to-use and easy-to-extend HUD for RaceRoom Racing Experience.

I started this project following the recent increase in the number of bugs which are currently live in RaceRoom's WebHud framework, resulting in the deprecation of many loved huds, including [OtterHud](https://forum.kw-studios.com/index.php?threads/otterhud-a-custom-webhud-with-additional-features.13152/) - which is the hud I was using up until now.

## Installation
1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Yuvix25/ReHUD/releases/latest).
2. Download and run the installer.
3. Done!

## Usage
Once you've installed the app, you will find a desktop shortcut to it, or you can manually find it by searching for "ReHUD" in the windows search menu. Run it with either of the above options, and you're good to go.  
The overlay is now running and will show up whenever you enter a session in RaceRoom. Since the app has no close button, you need to right click on its icon in the taskbar, and choose "Close window" in order to close it.
